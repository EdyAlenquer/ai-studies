This is a repository to publish my personal study projects. My aim is to keep track of my progress and current gaps.

I am making a conscious effort to use as few pre-built tools as possible to strengthen my understanding of the core concepts. By building most components from scratch, I am continuously deepening my knowledge and gaining hands-on experience. Whenever possible, I'm trying to compare the results of my implementation with some popular libraries, such as Scikit-Learn.
